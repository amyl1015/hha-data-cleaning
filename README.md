# hha-data-cleaning

First loaded the csv data into "data" folder.
Printed the columns and rows.
Cleaned the column names to all lower case and replaced spaces with underscore.
Dropped the "week" column due to bad data and dropped rows with missing values.
Converted the columns to its correct types.
Created a new column called "modality_inperson" and used the "learning modlality" column to replace "in person" to true and "remote" and "hybrid" to false.
